What is Text Grapher?
=====================

Text Grapher is a python library for rendering graphs and 3D geometries using
text. Rather than drawing with pixels in an image, it draws with characters in
a string. The goal is to make it so the user can create 2D and 3D animations
with only a few lines of code.

**For what purpose?** Text Grapher is mostly an educational novelty. Before
this project I had been using 3D software every day without understanding what
was happening under the hood. Putting this library together forced me to derive
the key concepts that make 3D software tick.
