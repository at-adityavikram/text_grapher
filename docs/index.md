# Text Grapher: 2D & 3D Graphics Rendered as Text

## Intro

**What is Text Grapher?** Text Grapher is a graphics library for rendering graphics using text. Rather than drawing lines using pixels in an image, it draws lines using characters in a string. 2D and 3D animations can quickly be composed and rendered as a series of text files or a gif.

**For what purpose?** The purpose of this python project is educational. Before this project I had been using 3D software every day without understanding what was happening under the hood. Putting this project together forced me to derive key concepts that make 3D software tick. Writing the Text Grapher API helped me understand how Blender's API works and where its structure comes from.
