# text_grapher

Render graphs and shapes using a grid of characters in a text file.

## What it does:

Text Grapher creates an animation of a cube spinning in space.
It uses provided characters to render each frame of the animation
as a .txt file. The animation can be watched by rapidly viewing
the text files in succession. OS X has the ability to preview files -
this works perfectly.

## Usage:

- install Python 3.X
- clone this repository.
- `cd` into it.
- run `pip install .`
- `cd` to where you want to save the generated text files.
- run `tg graph` and answer the prompts.
- open the generated folder to find your text files.
